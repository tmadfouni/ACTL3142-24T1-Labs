# ACTL3142 24T1

You can find all code done during labs and any slides used in this repository.

I'm aware some people are not great with coding and need a much more elementary introduction to everything programming related.

With that in mind I've also included a PDF ([click here if you're too lazy to find it](R_Tutorials_by_Prof_Beaulieu.pdf)) with links to some tutorials for R programming that were made by Professor Guillaume Boglioni Beaulieu when he taught ACTL1101 at UNSW.

I personally found them very useful when I was starting out with coding so hopefully they can give you a hand as well. 

Hope you enjoy/are enjoying the course!
